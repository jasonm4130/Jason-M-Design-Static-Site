lead: A simple store front to help raise awareness and money for charity.
---

Spot the Difference Shirts was a project I worked on to build a quick and simple store front. This would give Ariel an opportunity sell shirts to her large following, and raise much needed funds for charity.

One of the main goals for this project was that it needed to help Ariel to achieve goals that were related to the Miss World New Zealand competition. This competition placed large time constraints on the project, meaning that we had to bring it to completion as soon as possible.

To achieve this major objective it was decided that the best course of action would be to edit an already suitable HTML theme and then deploy this on a GitHub pages server.

A theme was chosen from <a href="http://html5up.net/">HTML 5 Up</a> A talented designer. This theme was tweaked and then deployed as soon as possible.

All content for this site was provided by Ariel and her team.

The overall project was a huge success helping Ariel to achieve her goals for the Miss World New Zealand competition, but more importantly raise funds and awareness for skin cancer, and those that suffer from this entirely preventable disease.
