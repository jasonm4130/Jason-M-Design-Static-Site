Cornerstone Content is a web content agency who create amazing content for their clients. This content then becomes a pillar upon which these websites and the businesses and people that they represent stand upon. I was able to work with Rob and his team to create this stunning and modern design piece.

The Cornerstone Content team wanted their website to stand out and focus heavily upon the content as this is their business. As such a huge part of the design was the blog and elements of the home page that will help the team to showcase this content.

While Rob, Myles and their team have years of experience creating amazing content, Cornerstone Content as a company is only a few short months old. This means that they needed their website to convert leads that they have generated into paying clients as quickly as possible. As such a high priority of the design was to have a high conversion rate.

Lastly the website is optimized for speed allowing their clients to use the home page and other pages as fast as possible making browsing and using the website an enjoyable experience for them and the Cornerstone Content team.
