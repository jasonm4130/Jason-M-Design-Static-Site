Money Nomad, is a website devoted to helping young entrepreneurs overcome the inherent challenges within this space.

I was first worked with Rob, the owner and CEO of Money Nomad when I was working on his other website Cornerstone Content. This venture was successful so Rob decided to keep me on as his web designer and I begun work on Money Nomad.

When I first started working on the site it was running a stock WordPress theme which Rob wanted done away with. It had served it purpose until then and had done well for the beginning stages of the site but with growth of his company Rob was looking for a completely customized solution.

We started by clearly defining the goals that both Rob and I had for the project. Some of these included:
  -Clean modern look
  -Clear call to actions
  -Fast loading times
  -Great user experience
  -Easily digestible content
  -Easy to edit
  -Built on WordPress
