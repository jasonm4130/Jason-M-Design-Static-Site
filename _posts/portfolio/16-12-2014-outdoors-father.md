Outdoors Father is a customized version of the Genesis Framework that was designed for this purpose. The blog about being a father and enjoying the outdoors is highly focused on providing great written content as well as stunning visual photographs, so this was a major factor in the design.

The theme conveys a natural feel will still being modern and conforming to all web standards, including responsive design standards.

<p>Working with Jason wasn’t just about getting a design out, it was about finding away to give my voice the right visual representation. Through the whole process I felt that we are trying to solve a problem while Jason was pushing me to define how I see my site, not just how it should look like.</p>
<p>After implementing Jason’s design (and the many tweaks), I have got great responses from my regular readers while seeing my traffic increases regularly – I guess the branding does work!</p>
