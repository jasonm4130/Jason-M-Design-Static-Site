Lynk is a blood donation app designed for a university assignment. The app theoretically allows for blood donors to track the use of the blood that they donated helping people to overcome their fear of needles by allowing them to see the good that their sacrifice has been able to achieve.

The website for the app showcases the visual aesthetics of the app design as this was one of our main focuses for the app. The website is a simple single page poster style allowing for the user to get a good idea of what the app is about and encouraging them to use the app and give blood.

Bootstraps responsive framework was one of the integral tools in creating the website, allowing for the website to look great on all devices. Animations were also added to this to grab the viewerâ€™s attention and focus them on the important parts.

Below you can see some high fidelity mock ups of what the app could look like if it was ever developed.
