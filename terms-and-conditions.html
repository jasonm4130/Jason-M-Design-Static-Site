        <p><strong>6. Customer Review.</strong> <strong>Jason M Design</strong>&nbsp;will provide the Customer with regular opportunities to review the appearance, layout and content of the project during the design and creation process. The initial stage of creation involves the design shell of the Website Design Project which, once finalised and approved by the Customer, will not be amended without additional cost to the Customer.
