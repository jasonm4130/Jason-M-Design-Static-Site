                    p Jason Matthew is a fantastic designer, exceptional idea generator, and professional businessman. Jason listened to my requirements, made the project his own, and developed a website that far surpassed my expectations. Jason has become my go-to designer and I expect to work with him on many future projects.

                    p Working with Jason wasn’t just about getting a design out, it was about finding a way to give my voice the right visual representation. Through the whole process I felt that we were trying to solve a problem while Jason was pushing me to define how I see my site, not just what it should look like. After implementing Jason’s design (and the many tweaks), I have got a great responses from my regular readers while seeing my traffic increases regularly – I guess the branding does work!
